# Code Exercises

Welcome to **Code Exercises**! 🎯

This repository is dedicated to my journey of improving my coding skills. I'm tackling challenges based on:

- **SOLID principles** 🏗️
- **Design patterns** 🧩
- **Algorithmics** 💻
- **Performance efficiency** 🚀
- **Best coding practices** 💡
- **Testing** 🧪

### 📆 What’s inside?

I challenge myself with a new exercise, which I solve based on various concepts and techniques. Once I finish the task, I compare my solution with AI-generated solutions to learn from them and improve.

This repo will contain:
- coding challenges 💻
- My solutions and thoughts on them 💬
- AI’s feedback and solutions for comparison 🤖

### 🚀 How I Learn

1. **Understand** the problem and write my initial solution.
2. **Test** my solution and improve it based on best practices.
3. **Compare** my solution with AI-generated solutions to understand alternative approaches.
4. **Learn** new tips and tricks to refine my skills.

This iterative process helps me stay sharp, learn constantly, and level up my programming expertise.

## 🚀 Technologies & Tools

- **Design Patterns** - For writing clean, maintainable code.
- **SOLID Principles** - To create robust and flexible software.
- **JUnit** - For unit testing and ensuring code correctness.
- **AI tools (Claude, GPT)** - To provide alternative solutions and insights.


## 🤖 Example of My Code Process

Here’s how I approach each exercise:

1. **Task:** Given a specific problem (e.g., implementing a sorting algorithm), I start by understanding the requirements.
2. **Solution:** I write a simple solution and test it.
3. **Refactor:** After testing, I look for ways to improve efficiency or follow coding best practices.
4. **Compare:** I use AI to generate alternative solutions, learn new techniques, and improve.
